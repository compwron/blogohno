## What if your whole codebase were a whole bunch of slack messages?

## Why?

Because the dream of chatops is not just dead but has arisen from the deep with new friends

## What are we giving up on? / Recreating?

Git. Possibly also SQL.

## What would that even mean?




# Data(base) migrations within the nightmare


Adding a column should not need to be a migration, and adding a column is implicit when you refer to it. Deleing a column should not happen. Columns can be garbage collected if you can prove that no depolyed code is relying on this column. Columns only relied upon by code run run in the last 30 days can be removed. (But at no point are we undeploying any code, so garbage collection will never occur.)

For these reasons, this system does not support `select *` and making a column non-nullable is an actual constriaint on everyone else using the database. In other words, "renaming should be YOUR" problem i.e. names are permenant at a certain level- future code must be backwards compatible with respect to renaming.

Indexes should not live in the model i.e. should not live next to the fields... not in teh code next to the fields...should be queryable

"I feel liek the way you sove this, ince wre reinventing sql, i syou... select whatever, indexed by... "
idempotenly creates or reuses an index, and then have an index retenetion policy
ceate index depenidng on the where???

preemptively create ian index whenever anything foreign keys into you

how do you defend against ppl whodont know how to use slack?
in markdown you can do code blocks with denes 
ircbridege

code blog -> functional url for code, therefore never garbage collect. 


Why not use a columnar store and then take no performance hit from these changes? (If you have no performance, taking a hit is meaningless!)

things to build that would need to be built in order to this
slackbot to detect code chunks
server for code chunks to be sent to
second slack 
"assuming we had a working system, what would the working sstem itself look like?"

assuming were not rewriting slack and have a aslack instance that shandling auth and handing bot recieveng authorized and trusted messages of what user did what 
cant have auth groups in slack but can have who gets added to which slack groups

ultimate osurece o authority is slack admin, cant be kept out of private channel
ultimate external source of truth, what webhook does slackbot post messages to from slckas end. 
the released version ofthe software...

autoscaling required

guids
"I come from urbit, fan of perma names, put onto devops the compexity of that being true or affordable, which feels to me like its doable"



db group stable, 1mb limit per deploy, poke somethign to exceed


how do you do any kind of observability fo this system
scaling is auto, throughput is... 

so this is intended to be a rep[lacement for git]


the core of it is is... 
to put code into repo, make a chunj of code
microservice is channel
code block is a file
code block replying to a message contianing a code block is "delete that file and" (reply is "link to previous message" in slack)
a thread is a branch
or instead of replying, a message with the same filename, make the bot post a diff in teh message about... the url for... 
slack rate limits? not multiple bot messages than human messages? notifying of... 

slack backups to json regularly

code is nominally stored in slack, backed up to table... 

something grabs all the code from slack and 
grab most recent message in thread isntead of recalculating, cache, ? 
rom message deiverd column, first in cain of replues, first in column, what when is the mewssage posted... idex on tuple of that to get per message most recent. 
the more code you have, the longer it will take to reply
optimistic, less than 100mb code in system, perf is ok or at least solvable... 

more than 1100 mb of external depenxvies
git hustiry
git hisotry per line give up on
code gets approved by a certain number of thumbs up... 

code block is a file
refactorig is fucked
is that different than usual

one of the ocmmon lints is dont make your fules too long right, so if the code block is longer than the slack message liit then ok for attachments
at a minimum need to attack CSVs into ... 
images on website that are not base64, svg only lol
brute force a dalle prompt that generated the hing reliably

important modern worksflow feature sthat will be missing:

you will want to export to git, git hulk import
lets you do PRs on github repo... delaring defeat, ways to not suck (was tha ton the roadmap???)

the obvious alertante meme andser is build in prolog or datalog

what are some complicated db migrations? how can we plan for them? 


how come up with? chatops? node script was upstream of this, just ssh in... slack bots.. a different type of terminal... natural language emulation sofr sending reminders instead of sheell thermianl... slackbot let you ssh into prod and do things... let the world have a record of your sins, if you have  devops channel ... d you ned oher mahanism for code storage or just move intot his sytem...
